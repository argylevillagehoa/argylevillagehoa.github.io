<div><u>Argyle Village HOA (AVHOA) Fees</u></div>

Our managment company is <a href="https://portal.dhbader.com">D.H. Bader Management (formerly IKO CM)</a>.  D.H. Bader handles your HOA fees account.<br />
<br />
The AVHOA fees for <strong>2025</strong> are $636 annually or <strong>$53 per month.</strong> At settlement you were informed how your fees will be handled; typically, whether you have to start paying fees from the date of settlement, or whether you need to reimburse the seller for the balance of the year&rsquo;s fees (if this is the case, you should not have a balance due until January of the following year). <br />
<br />
<strong>When you purchased your home, yourself or the settlement agent are required to send IKO a copy of the property settlement statement.</strong> Receipt of the settlement documents by IKO triggers the mailing of a monthly payment booklet. If you do not receive a booklet from IKO within 4 to 6 weeks of moving into the neighborhood, please call them to make sure that they received the property settlement statement and are processing the information. <strong><font color="#ff0000">Just because you have not received a booklet, you are still required to pay HOA fees.</font></strong> Contact any Board member if you have not received a payment booklet from IKO. If you have a question about your account or about IKO, please contact a Board member first, not IKO.<br />
<br />
Each January IKO sends you a payment book that shows the new monthly dues for upcoming year. Although this invoice will be for only one month&rsquo;s fees, it makes our administration much simpler if you can either pay the full year&rsquo;s fees in advance (which is what many of our members choose to do). If this is not convenient, you may pay on a six-monthly, or quarterly basis. However, please note that your payments are due at the beginning of whatever payment period you select.<br />

<u>Architectural Changes, Exterior Painting, Additions, etc.</u>

<p><font size="3">We hope one of the reasons you purchased a home in Argyle Village is because of the award-winning community style, which was designed to reflect a &ldquo;Cape Cod&rdquo; style. Maintaining and preserving that style is important in order to protect the investment that both you and your neighbors have made in your home. Therefore, one of the responsibilities of the Board is to review exterior architectural changes or improvements (e.g., shutters, storm doors, entryway doors, decks, extensions, etc.) that people may wish to make. If you are contemplating making any exterior architectural changes to your home, you will need to notify your immediate neighbors about your proposed changes, and submit the proposals to the AVHOA&rsquo;s Architectural Review Committee for approval prior to beginnings your project. You also must obtain any necessary approvals from Montgomery County, and comply with relevant County codes and regulations, if applicable). Copies of the appropriate AVHOA architectural change guidelines and neighbor notification form can be obtained from the AVHOA secretary.<br />
    <br />
    It is hoped that you will be respectful of the neighborhood and be careful to comply with the Argule Village HOA architectural change requirements. As stated in the bylaws, the Board has the authority to remove, at the owner&rsquo;s expense, any non-approved or non-compliant changes. However, the Board does not like to take such measures against a neighbor.</font>&nbsp;<br />

<u>White Picket Fences and Common Areas</u>
    
The picket fences parallel to the front of the houses (but not those along the side of the yards or at the back) are maintained and painted by contractors employed by AVHOA. The costs involved are included in your AVHOA fees. All the picket fences were repainted in summer 2002. The picket fences were replaced in 2008. Please note that AVHOA does not repair damage caused by negligence--a particular case is damage to gates and posts caused by lawn-mowing contractors using oversize machinery. If the AVHOA contractor has to make such repairs, the costs will be charged to your account.

The fence between the pond and the golf course was replaced in 2009. The fence around the pond was replaced in 2009.
The pond is the one significat piece of common open space.  See the Grounds section for more on the pond.
    
Security Patrols
    
We are fortunate to live in a low-crime area, and problems with vandalism and other disturbances have been rare. 

If you see a crime in progress, or if there is an emergency, first call the police on 911. If it is not an emergency, use the police non-emergency number, (301) 279 8000. Only after calling the police should you contact the security patrols, following the instructions in the flyer.
Montgomery County Services 
Many services are functions of the local government, not the HOA. A quick guide to county services can be found on the <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/">Montgomery County website.</a>
